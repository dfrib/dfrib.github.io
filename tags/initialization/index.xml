      <description>What is an aggregate class type?
 Aggregate class types makes up a special family of class types that can be, particularly, initialized by means of aggregate initialization, using direct-list-init or copy-list-init, T aggr_obj{arg1, arg2, ...} and T aggr_obj = {arg1, arg2, ...}, respectively. The rules governing whether a class is an aggregate or not, however, are not entirely straight-forward, particularly as the rules have been changing between different releases of the C++ standard.</description>
