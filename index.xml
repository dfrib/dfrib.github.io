      <description>I few weeks ago I decided to try to set up a personal blog, aimed primarily at software development topics, but perhaps also containing one or another post about my other interests; climbing/bouldering and writing and performing music.
I intend for the blog to be a place that can encourage me to write up ideas and experiences as they pass through in my day-to-day life, however without my usual need to thoroughly explain every essential background detail for the potential reader.</description>
