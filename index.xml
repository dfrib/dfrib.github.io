      <description>Is there any scenario where we should prefer using static instead of an unnamed namespace to give a name internal linkage?
 The other day I was in a situation where I wanted to hide a function name from other translation units (TU) than its own (internal linkage), but I also needed the name to be found via Argument-dependent lookup (ADL) from a scope within its own TU that could not find it via (un-)qualified name lookup.</description>

      <description>I few weeks ago I decided to try to set up a personal blog, aimed primarily at software development topics, but possibly also containing one or another post about my other interests; climbing/bouldering and writing and performing music. Starting with this post, the blog is now up.
I intend for the blog to be a place that can encourage me to write up ideas and experiences as they pass through in my day-to-day life, however without my usual need to thoroughly explain every essential background detail for the potential reader.</description>
